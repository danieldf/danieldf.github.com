The original motivation for a *Two-Column Landscape Format* came from
"[Advocating Two-Column Landscape Format for Scholarly Online Articles](http://scholardox.com/pubs/Landscape.pdf)".

However, because of typographical issues, among some other, I personally prefer to use the [KOMA-scripts](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/koma-script/).

This is a GitHub repository for a KOMA-script template for Landscape Reading: [Landscape Reading on GitHub](https://github.com/danieldf/Landscape_Reading).

Enjoy!
