The original motivation a local ad-blocking alternative came from
"[Pi-hole: A Raspberry Pi Ad-Blocker with DNS Caching (Ultra-fast)](http://jacobsalmela.com/raspberry-pi-block-ads-adtrap/)" and "[Pi-hole: Raspberry Pi Ad-Blocker (Advanced Setup)](http://jacobsalmela.com/raspberry-pi-ad-blocker-advanced-setup/)".

There is a GitHub repository for the Pi-Hole ad-blocker and DNS caching: [Pi-Hole on GitHub](https://github.com/jacobsalmela/pi-hole).

Enjoy!
