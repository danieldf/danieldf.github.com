## Solution Space of Gauge Theories and Quantum Phases

Quantum Phases are defined to be the different quantum states at zero temperature.
A Quantum Phase Transition (QPT) happens when a system undergoes a change from one
quantum phase to another, at zero temperature. It describes an abrupt change in the
ground-state of the system caused by its quantum fluctuations. A Quantum Critical Point
(QCP) is a point in the phase diagram of a system (at zero temperature) that separates
two quantum phases. In addition to this, QCPs distort the fabric of the phase diagram
creating a phase of “quantum critical matter” fanning out to finite temperatures from
the QCP. As expected, at the QCP, the system exhibits spacetime scale invariance, justifying
the idea that it can be modeled via a Conformal Field Theory (CFT) — because of this, sometimes
the QCP is referred only as a “conformal point”. The connection with High Energy Physics,
namely with Gauge Theory, can be made almost instantly. There are two ways to best understand
this phenomenon. One of them is via the analytic continuation of the partition function of a
given system. However, this can be particularly tricky, since it involves \\(\mathbb{C}\\)omplex (Picard–Lefschetz)
and infinite-dimensional Morse theory. On the other hand, this scenario can be addressed in a
constructive manner, that reveals more clearly what is at stake. If we start from a \\(0\\)-dimensional
gauge theory (\\(D0\\)-brane), for any field (scalar, fermion, vector, matrix, tensor, Lie or graded Lie algebra),
and evaluate its Schwinger–Dyson equation (which is nothing but the differential version of the
integral problem treated via a partition function), we clearly see that, because this differential
equation has as many solutions as its degree, we are supposed to have one integral representation for
each one of these solutions — and each one of these integral representations is what we call a
partition function. Therefore, there will be more than one possible partition function, one for
each available quantum phase. And the relation among them can be clearly seen through appropriate
analytic continuations and asymptotic analysis (Stokes' phenomena, wall-crossing), which is how
this approach ties in with the previously mentioned one. This maps out the Solution Space of a
given Gauge Theory, revealing its “glassy” character, somewhat analogous to what happens in spin
systems. Furthermore, understanding the Feynman Path Integral as a Linear Canonical Transform, we
can make an analogy with the Penrose–Ward transform, establishing a correspondence between two spaces,
where one contains the appropriate integration cycles, while the other contains a certain choice of
[vector] parameters for a representation of the system's singularities in terms of Fox's \\(H\\)-function
(which is a Mellin–Barnes transform, usually of a more general character than a polylogarithm).
Also, with this understanding, we are also able to generalize the interpretation of Feynman's Path
Integral as a sum of more general paths than just a Brownian one, such as Lévy flights, and so on.
This brings to the foreground the nonlinear Fredholm theory of the Schwinger–Dyson differential
operator, which in turn has something to say about the construction of Seiberg–Witten invariants.
Finally, understanding the role of the matrix parameter of the Linear Canonical Transform helps to
clarify the origin of some dualities.
