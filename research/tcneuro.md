## Ersätz-Brain

The [Ersätz-Brain](http://www.cog.brown.edu/Research/ErsatzBrainGroup/index.html)
is a project that seeks to build a computational model based on
many of the functional properties of neo-cortex, e.g., the efficient execution
of massively parallel software displaying cognitive abilities. Examples of these
software applications would be: natural language understanding, text processing,
conceptually based (semantic) internet search, natural human-computer
interfaces, cognitively based data mining, sensor fusion, and image
understanding; i.e., typically the so-called "big data" and scalability issues
facing us today. The project has received funding support from both the Air
Force High Performance Computing division and a DARPA grant whose goal is to
develop hierarchical intelligent computational architectures.

The basic tenant of the Ersätz-Brain is that higher-order cognitive processes emerge
out of the interaction of numerous modular complex and dynamical systems. We have
concentrated our energies on developing a phenomenological and algorithmic model
of several different tasks that are found at the intersection of perception and cognition.

We have begun to develop a theoretical physics-based model that parallels the phenomenological
model under development. I have been actively pursuing a theory that links multi-state models
(e.g., Potts model) with higher-order invariant structures found in knot theory. Additionally,
I have begun to address issues pertaining to the underlying structures that govern multi-scale
dynamical systems. One potentially very important consequence being the insight that
cognitive/perceptual invariance is the result of the development of fundamental physical
structures, such as knots. If this proves to be correct, it could potentially change the
implications of many cognitive-neuroscience systems models in the future.

Our further pursuits include the use of more contemporary tools from Physics (e.g., scaling
and renormalization, effective field theory, universality) and Information Theory (e.g., Entropy,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, information geometry, critical phenomena) in order to open a whole
new window into the understanding of Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience. Moreover, the
application of massive parallel computational techniques, such as GPU computing and high-performance
scientific computing, can definitely foster the use of the tools previously mentioned: there is
something to be learned from the so-called "Computational Physics" and "Lattice QCD" community,
that faces one of the most computationaly intensive problems in Physics. Success would be a major
scientific accomplishment because it would show we understand something important about the way
the brain works: we can build one.
